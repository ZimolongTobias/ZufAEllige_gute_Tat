# Zufällige gute Tat


## What ist it?

"Zufällige gute Tat" is a small machine that allows the user to receive one or more daily tasks, stored in capsules, that promote a higher quality of life by pressing a button. The tasks are intended to lead to a more environmentally conscious, social, and active lifestyle. When planning and designing the first prototype, emphasis was placed on making the device as simple and intuitive as possible. Additionally, recycled materials were used in line with the overarching theme of recycling. Due to its modular design, the device can also be used as a regular cabinet with or without technology located in the bottom compartment, and this alternative use is easily recognizable from the device's form.


## User manual:

There is a green button on the top of the device. When this button is pressed while the device is powered, a speaker will play a melody, a slot containing the capsules will be selected, and a container from the corresponding compartment will be brought into the collection area. Now, the selected capsule can be opened to reveal a piece of paper with a good deed that you should accomplish for the day.
To operate the machine, you need to upload the code to an Arduino Micro for it to work safely and properly. If you are using Visual Studio Code, the PlatformIO IDE-Extension should be installed. After opening the project, it is recommended to restart the program to avoid upload port errors when uploading the code to the Arduino Micro [02.04.2023]. If you want to use it on another editor or use the command line tool check https://platformio.org/install/integration [03.04.2023].
